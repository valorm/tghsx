            <h2><i class="fas fa-tasks"></i> Internal Security Measures</h2>
            <p>While we work towards a formal audit, we have implemented a rigorous internal review process to minimize risks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Test Suite:</strong> Our smart contracts have extensive unit and integration tests covering all core functions, including deposits, borrowing, liquidations, and withdrawals.</li>
                <li><strong>Peer Review Process:</strong> All contract code undergoes a mandatory peer review process by at least one other developer before being merged into the main branch.</li>
                <li><strong>Known Vulnerability Mitigation:</strong> We actively check against common smart contract vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy (mitigated with OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard), integer overflows, and oracle manipulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Battle-Tested Libraries:</strong> The protocol is built upon widely-used and audited libraries from OpenZeppelin and Chainlink to ensure a secure foundation.</li>

                <li>
                    <strong class="status complete">Phase 1: Testnet Launch (In Progress)</strong>
                    <p>The protocol is currently live on the Polygon Amoy testnet to gather public feedback and identify potential issues in a controlled, no-risk environment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="status planned">Phase 2: Formal Audits (Planned)</strong>
                    <p>Before any mainnet launch, we will engage one or more reputable, independent security firms to conduct a full audit of the smart contract suite. All findings and subsequent fixes will be made public for full transparency.</p>

                    <p>Following the audits, we will launch a bug bounty program on a platform like Immunefi to incentivize continuous review of our code by the broader security community.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-flag"></i> Responsible Disclosure Policy</h2>
            <p>Security is a collective effort. If you discover a potential security vulnerability in our smart contracts or web application, we ask that you report it to us privately so we can address it before it can be exploited.</p>

            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>This policy applies to the following assets currently on the Polygon Amoy Testnet:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The `CollateralVault.sol` smart contract.</li>
                <li>The `TGHSXToken.sol` smart contract.</li>
                <li>The tGHSX web application hosted at its official URL.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Out of scope:</strong> Any third-party services, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and social engineering attempts.</p>

            <h3>How to Report</h3>
            <p>Please send a detailed report of the vulnerability to our secure email address:</p>
            <p class="code-block">security@tghsx.com</p>
            <p>Your report should include, if possible:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.</li>
                <li>Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.</li>
                <li>Any relevant proof-of-concept code, transaction hashes, or screenshots.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We will provide a timely acknowledgement of your report (within 48 hours).</li>
                <li>We will work diligently to validate, remediate, and release a fix for the vulnerability.</li>
                <li>We will maintain open communication with you throughout the process.</li>
                <li>For all valid, first-reported vulnerabilities, we will offer public acknowledgement and a reward, subject to the terms of our future bug bounty program.</li>
