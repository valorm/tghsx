# Full Deployment & Backend Startup Script (v2 - with Clean Install)
#
# This script automates the entire process:
# 1. Cleans and reinstalls all Node.js dependencies to prevent caching issues.
# 2. Cleans and compiles the Hardhat project.
# 3. Deploys all contracts using the deploy_all.js script.
# 4. Verifies the contracts on Polygon Amoy Scan.
# 5. Starts the Python backend server.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Make the script executable: chmod +x full_deploy.sh
# 2. Run the script: ./full_deploy.sh
# ==============================================================================

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
